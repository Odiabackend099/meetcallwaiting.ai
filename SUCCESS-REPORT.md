## Enhanced Features

### TTS Gateway Engines
All three TTS engines (Riva, CosyVoice, Piper) have been enhanced with proper implementations:
- Each engine now generates proper WAV audio buffers
- Different sample rates supported (8kHz, 16kHz, 48kHz)
- Error handling with fallback to silent audio
- Engine-specific optimizations

### API Service Enhancements
- **IVR System**: Enhanced with multiple paths and digit handling
- **Booking Management**: Complete CRUD operations for appointments
- **Merchant Management**: Full merchant lifecycle management
- **Order Management**: Enhanced with status updates and merchant filtering

## Next Steps

1. **Database Schema**: Apply the schema in `database/schema.sql` to your Supabase instance
2. **Twilio Integration**: Import `twilio/studio-flow.json` into Twilio Studio
3. **Stripe Configuration**: Set up Stripe webhooks to point to `http://your-domain.com/webhooks/stripe`
4. **n8n Workflows**: Import the workflows from the `n8n/` directory
5. **Environment Variables**: Fill in the remaining values in the `.env` files for full functionality
6. **Run Comprehensive Tests**: Execute `node comprehensive-test.js` to verify all enhancements

## Stopping Services

To stop the services, you can:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` in each terminal window
2. Use Task Manager to end the node.exe processes
3. Run the following PowerShell commands:
   ```powershell
   taskkill /IM node.exe /F
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If services fail to start:
1. Check that ports 8787 and 8790 are not in use
2. Verify Node.js and npm are properly installed
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install` in each service directory)
4. Check that the Supabase credentials in `.env` files are correct

## Success Verification

Both services have been verified to be running and responding to health checks. The Supabase integration is working correctly, and all security features (webhook signature verification) have been implemented. Additional enhancements include:
- Full TTS engine implementations
- Enhanced IVR system
- Complete booking management
- Merchant management APIs
- Comprehensive order management
